- the contents here relate to the tutorial at https://anchored.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/
- these are the most tested and probably most useful downstream programs for a synteny 
anaylsis with AncST
- the idea is that by using MCScanX genome-wide macrosynteny is computed based on 
AncST anchors and consequentially, high confidence chains of alignments are obtained 
which represent larger regions of probable orthology and the output can also be used 
to study large genome rearrangements visually by using mcdraw.py to draw the alignments 
of genomes. greedily. custom scripts are still needed at this point to quantify rearrangements 
of interest
- the synthology pipeline makes use of the MCScanX output and is used to infer orthology between 
single or groups of genetic elements of interest which can be DNA (_nucl version) or protein (_prot) 
sequences of any type
