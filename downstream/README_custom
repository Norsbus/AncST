- make sure there is a coords file in the root directory (.. from here)

- run draw_synteny with an integer as the first argument,
for example: ./draw_synteny.py 50000

- the number is the number of nucleotides up- and downstream
of the coordinates in coords considered for synteny analysis

- thus draw_synteny will look 50000 nucleotides upstream and
downstream of the coordinates in coords and check if there are
any anchors in that region shared between the genomes/coordinates/elements

- in clusters/{number} there are txt files with a description of the clusters
of elements found and in images/{number} there are png and svg files with
the images of the clusters

- a cluster is a set of elements which share synteny anchors

- "get_syn_regions.py": this script was developed for the following scenario:
you have a region/genetic elements of interest in a "coords" file and want to 
again find syntenic regions in other species. you may have additional elements 
for those species or not. you can also have any combination of subject and 
target species. subject species are all which have elements in the "coords" 
file or whichever you specify (see --help) and target are either defined 
in a file called "orgs" with a species per line (same name as for the anchor 
calculation and therefore how the input genome was names without suffix 
initially) or all species for which there are anchors are taken. the you can 
specify a bunch of things, mainly margin and number of iterations (see again 
--help) and the program will iteratively find pairwise matches of anchors 
around the elements of interest, record new regions which are found, extract 
those anchors and repeat
