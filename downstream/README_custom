- make sure there is a coords file in the root directory (.. from here)

- run draw_synteny with an integer as the first argument,
for example: ./draw_synteny.py 50000

- the number is the number of nucleotides up- and downstream
of the coordinates in coords considered for synteny analysis

- thus draw_synteny will look 50000 nucleotides upstream and
downstream of the coordinates in coords and check if there are
any anchors in that region shared between the genomes/coordinates/elements

- in clusters/{number} there are txt files with a description of the clusters
of elements found and in images/{number} there are png and svg files with
the images of the clusters

- a cluster is a set of elements which share synteny anchors
