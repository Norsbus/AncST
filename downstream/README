- there are some packages required...errors will tell you which
are missing,just try to install them one by one
e.g. for python you need Biopython and pygenomeviz
e.g. you need the blast command line tools

- alternatively you can use conda and the requirements.txt file
which includes many redundant packages tho
e.g.: conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt


# names of stuff #

- species/organisms are given simple names like {number}org
e.g., 1org as are there respective chromosomes/scaffolds/contigs
like {number}orgchr{number}, e.g. 1orgchr1. this is to avoid
format issues for the downstream program. 
the correspondence of these names with the actual species names 
is given in utils/mapping. this file is also used to construct 
a python dictionary in multiple scripts which can also be used
to see the correspondence (see e.g. custom/draw_synteny.py).
furthermore, there is a script "replace_name" in utils/ which
will take a txt file as the first argument and replace all
occurences of the fake names with the original names and write
it to a file whose name/path should be given as the second
argument


# workflow #

suggested workflow genome-wise analysis:

- run MCScanX and/or i-ADHRoE as described in the folders
- it takes the anchors to execute these programs which can
give a good overview of global, genome-wide correspondences
between the genomes

suggested workflow to find orthologs:

either:
1.1 create a file "coords" in this directory with the following format:
genomes<tab>chromosome<tab>start<tab>end<tab>
- if runs of dialign (https://dialign.gobics.de/) or Smore
(https://github.com/AnneHoffmann/Smore) are planned, its best to
ensure that the genome name corresponds to to a file {genome}.fasta
(the genome file in fasta format) which is needed to run these
programs with the custom anchors, see READMEs in Smore/ and dialign/
- the coordinates should be in forward direction (end > start)
- the strand is "forward" or "reverse"
or:
1.2 or go to utils and follow README_utils to create coords
from a protein query file

then:
2. go to the custom folder and follow README_custom
3. go to the MCSCanX folder and follow README_MCScanX
