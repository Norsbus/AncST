1. run ./make_anc.py with a number of how many nucleotides to take up- and downstream
of the elements defined in ../coords and the path to the genomes of the genomes defined
in ../coords as the first argument (the genomes have to be accesible as {name_from_coords}.fasta)
- it will make an anchor file for dialign and write the sequences in ../coords
in a fasta file
2. make sure you have an executable of dialign (https://dialign.gobics.de/) 
3. run dialign with the -anc option, e.g. ./dialign2-2 -n -anc to_align
